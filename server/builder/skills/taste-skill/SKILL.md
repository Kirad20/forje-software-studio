> Forja note: this text comes from Taste Skill by Leonxlnx (MIT; see NOTICE.md and the LICENSE next to it). Forja has no draw, inspect, assets or scenes scripts and no network image search: use the owner's files, inline SVG and CSS for imagery, and browser_test screenshots to look. The Forja manual's rules win over anything here: tokens in base.css, screens built from @forja/ui, CSS Modules for layout, no inline visual styles, no new npm packages outside the catalog.

# Taste Skill

A page built by a model usually looks like the average of every page the model has seen: a centred
headline over three lines, a little label above it, a row of icon cards, a soft gradient, a few thin
rules and a monospace caption. Nothing in it is wrong and nothing in it was decided.

One warning learned in testing. Taking the ornaments away is only half the job; a page that has lost its
labels, rules and cards and gained nothing in their place reads as thin, and blind jurors rightly prefer
a richer page with tells over an empty page without them. The other half is substance: type set
larger, whole fields of colour, real pictures of this subject's world (found or drawn), and every
section carrying its full content. The skill is built to give you that; do not trade it for restraint.

## How to work in Forja

The upstream run deals directions with scripts. Here you do the thinking steps yourself and build with the kit; the house rules and the laws below are the style.

### 1. Read the brief and the project

Find out what is real: the subject, the audience, the one thing the page must get someone to do, the
stack, any existing brand (colours, fonts, logo), and above all **what imagery truly exists**: the
project's own photographs or product shots, a real interface that can be shown, an image generation
tool you can call, or nothing. Do not plan around pictures you do not have. Nothing of its own is
rarely nothing at all: the subject's city, street, materials and history are in open archives and
museums, free to use with a credit (step 6, `scripts/assets.mjs`).

If the request is vague, decide and state your reading in one line instead of asking. Ask only when a
missing fact blocks the work (for example, no product name).

Then **inventory the subject** in your notes: eight to twelve things that belong to this client and to
no competitor. Look for its name and what the name means; its address, door number, street and
neighbourhood, and what that place looks like (its tiles, signs, paint colours, typefaces on its shop
fronts, its light, its weather); the numbers in the brief (seats, rooms, minutes to the sea, the
price, the year); the constraint it lives with (only one batch a month, closed in winter, by
appointment); its materials and colours; its rituals and hours (the oven lit at five, the ferry at
seven); the printed things of its world (a timetable, a label, a ticket, a sign). This list is where
the idea comes from in step 4. In blind tests, the page that won each brief was built from an item on
such a list (the client's name and what it means, the street it stands in, the one constraint that
makes it what it is), and the pages that lost had a good composition with a category idea. The list
is also your picture search: each place, material and printed thing on it is a query for step 6.

### 2. Write the argument

Before any design, list the page as claims with their proof, one line per section, the way
`references/copy.md` §1 shows. The claims decide which sections exist and in what order. Delete any
section that has no claim. This is how you avoid the stock sequence of hero, logos, three features,
testimonial, pricing, call to action.

### 2. Write the argument

Before any design, list the page as claims with their proof, one line per section (load part `copy`). The claims decide which sections exist and in what order. Delete any section that has no claim: that is how you avoid the stock sequence of hero, logos, three features, testimonial, pricing, call to action.

### 4. Find the idea

The direction is a way of composing. The idea is what makes the page belong to this subject and no
other. Write this sentence in your notes and do not start building until both blanks are filled from
the subject itself:

> On this page, **[something that belongs to the subject]** becomes **[the device the direction calls for]**.

Places to look for the first blank:

- **Its output.** What does the thing produce? Put the real output on the page as material. (A camera
  that prints poems delivered its copy as paper slips.)
- **Its object or shape.** What does it physically look like, in cross-section, in silhouette?
  Enlarge it, crop it, make it the frame or the one motif.
- **Its name.** Can the letters hold a photograph, stack into a wall, split to two corners?
- **Its place.** Is there one view that makes someone want to be there?
- **Its ritual.** Is there a sequence the page can perform as it scrolls?
- **Its artefact.** What printed thing already exists in its world: ticket, menu, label, receipt,
  invitation, folder, manual?
- **Its opposite.** Which other category owns the feeling this one lacks?

Fill the first blank from your inventory (step 1), not from the category. **The competitor test:** put
the nearest real competitor in the sentence (the bakery two streets away, another oak furniture maker,
another hut on the same mountain). If the sentence still works, the idea belongs to the category: a
loaf of bread is every bakery; the seven doors of the street this one is named after are only this one.
"Clean and modern" is not an idea. The sites the study's panel scored lowest were the ones whose idea
was recorded as "none beyond the standard formula".

**One live thing.** Give the page one thing the visitor can do, or that is different for each visit,
made from the idea: pick a wood and see the chair in it; type your name and see it cut in the
foundry's letters; set the loan and read the real monthly figure; see whether the hut's stove is lit
right now and how long until the last ferry; choose a size and see it against the room. In blind tests every winning page had one and the jurors named it first. Rules: it uses the subject's real content, it works on a phone with a thumb, it has a plain
fallback without script, it never blocks reading, and it is one thing, not a playground. It is
built in step 6 as part of the page, not added as motion in step 9.

**The scenes carry the idea too.** The scroll scenes on the sheet are devices waiting for a subject.
Decide what each one shows from your inventory before building: the fly-through passes through this
studio's own title cards, the route is the road this shipment really takes, the picture that opens to
the whole screen is the room the guest will wake up in. A scene filled with pictures that could belong
to anyone is a screensaver.

### 5. Write the words

Write the whole page as a copy deck (plain text) before markup, following `references/copy.md`:

- **Every headline fits in two lines or fewer at every width.** Do the arithmetic in copy.md §2 before
  committing to a sentence: about 32 characters is safe everywhere at a confident size. The studied
  gallery heroes have a median of 5 words and 32 characters.
- One supporting sentence, directly under the headline (32–48px below it) and shown with it, never
  docked at the foot of the first screen or held back by an animation. When the headline is a name or
  a figure of speech, this sentence says plainly what the thing is. One primary action, named for what
  it does, as a real button on the first screen.
- **The first screen answers the visitor's first question in large type.** For an event: what it is,
  when and where (the dates belong in the headline or at the second size, never only in small text).
  For a product: what it is and what it costs or does. For a person: who and what they do. Every
  section the visitor came for (the line-up, the menu, the rooms, the price) has its own heading and
  its own place in the navigation.
- **Write the full content.** Every section the brief asks for delivers its information completely:
  the whole menu with prices, each room with its own details, every speaker and talk, the price with
  what it includes, an answer for each real question. Thin sections are the commonest reason a clean
  page loses to a busier one.
- Sample details are expected where the brief leaves gaps (dish names, room names and rates, project
  titles) so the design is seen at full density; list them in the report for the client to confirm.
  Proof is never invented: no customers, quotes, reviews, press, logos or business statistics.

## House rules

These hold on every build, whatever the direction. `inspect.mjs` measures them.

| Rule | Instead |
| --- | --- |
| **Headlines: two lines or fewer, at every width.** Every `h1`–`h6`, and the main line of the first screen whatever its tag. | Cut words. Then widen the measure. Size last. |
| **A clear title on the first screen**, in the page's one `h1`, and a heading on every section. | Say what this is: the name with what it does, the product with what it is for, the event with its date and place. |
| **Equal outer margins; no section huddled on one side** with the other half of the screen empty. | Close every void with something on its far side: the section's picture, a second column, a list, a figure. |
| **No blank stretches** taller than about half a screen. | The normal section gap. A deliberate rest is a placed picture or a field of colour, once per page. |
| **Statements are paragraphs.** An intro sentence or a quotation set large is marked up as `<p>` or `<blockquote>`, stays at statement size (36px or less on desktop, 24px on a phone) and runs to about 25 words, three lines. | Larger than that it is a headline and the two-line rule applies. In blind tests jurors read a 42px sentence over four lines as a four-line headline. |
| **No eyebrows.** No small label above a heading, no pill badge above the headline, no "New ·" chip. | Put the information in the heading or the first sentence, or drop it. |
| **No monospace** outside real code blocks. | The text face. Tabular figures where numbers align. |
| **No index numbering.** No 01 / 02 / 03, no (001), no "Step 2". | Order shown by position, size, or the words. A real `<ol>` if order matters. |
| **No thin rules.** No hairline dividers, no 1px outlined boxes, no grid lines, crosshairs or crop marks. | Space. A step in background tone. A change of scale. A filled shape. |
| **No gradients.** Not as backgrounds, not on buttons, not in text. | Flat colour, or a real photograph. A neutral scrim under text on a photo is the one exception. |
| **No shadows on things at rest.** No glows. | A tone step between surfaces. Shadows only on what truly floats: a menu, a dialog. |
| **No assistant palette.** No yellow-cream ground with terracotta or rust; no violet or indigo. | The dealt palette. |
| **No tiny uppercase letter-spaced labels.** | Sentence case at a readable size. |
| **No icon-topped feature cards, no rows of identical cards.** | The dealt section blueprint. |
| **No glass.** No backdrop blur panels, no floating pill navigation. | A plain bar: wordmark, a few links, one action. |
| **No emoji, no gradient blobs, no decorative shapes, no fake dashboards of grey bars.** | A real picture, a real interface fragment, or nothing. |
| **No styled accent word** in a headline (italic, serif, coloured, underlined). | One face, one colour. The words carry the emphasis. |
| **Two typefaces at most,** usually one. | The dealt type system. |

Three places keep their own conventions and are left alone by the inspector: real code in
`<pre>`/`<code>` (monospace is correct there), real tables and form fields (they may have lines), and
a real interface fragment whose root carries the attribute `data-ui` (the product's own borders and
menus; see `references/imagery.md` §7).

Why these, honestly. Some are what the study measured: among the 247 sites, those the panel scored
7.5 or higher used icon feature cards 1% of the time against 28% for sites under 6.5, pill badges 14%
against 34%, gradients 22% against 52%, shadows 24% against 48%, tiny tracked caps 16% against 57%.
Others are the owner's taste and go against current gallery fashion: monospace labels, index numbers
and hairline grids are actually *more* common on award sites than on weak ones, which is exactly why
generators imitate them and why they now read as costume. They are banned here without exception.
`references/tells.md` keeps the dated registry.

Removing ornament leaves space. Never fill it with another ornament. Fill it with scale (make the main
thing larger), with the full content, with a picture made for this subject, or with a field of flat
colour. Leave it empty on purpose once per page at most.

## Laws of the craft

Short form. Numbers are from the study unless marked as house style.

**Type**
- Two or three sizes do the visible work: one very large, one small, nothing in between. Median
  headline-to-body ratio on the studied sites is 4.3; the best go far beyond (largest type: median
  8.4vw on the top sites against 5.0vw on the weak ones).
- Display type: tracking -0.02 to -0.05em, leading 0.85–1.05. Text: 16–20px, leading 1.45–1.6,
  45–75 characters per line.
- Five sizes on a page is the ceiling. One family is normal (a third of the studied sites); two is the
  limit.
- Left-aligned by default. Centre at most one moment.

**Space**
- One grid, one pair of tight margins (16–32px), used everywhere; large things run to the edges. Text
  blocks share two or three left edges on the whole page.
- Asymmetry inside the grid, never in the frame: the two outer margins are equal, and an off-centre
  heading is answered by something at the far side of the grid.
- The gap between sections is clearly larger than any gap inside one: 120–240px on desktop (the study's median is about 240).
- Each section has a different composition from its neighbours; none is a card grid.

**Colour**
- One ground, one ink, one accent. The accent appears on the action and perhaps one other thing.
- Running text in the full ink. A page set in soft grey reads unfinished.
- Surfaces are separated by a small step in tone, never by a line or a shadow.
- A section may change the whole field colour. Nothing fades into anything.

**Imagery**
- One dominant image beats six small ones. On the top-scored sites the hero media covers at least half
  the first screen 68% of the time.
- Same crop ratios, same treatment, square corners unless the direction says otherwise (73% of the
  studied sites leave media square).
- No image is better than a placeholder, an icon, or an abstract shape. A picture drawn for this
  subject, in its colours and with care, is better than either. A real picture of its world, found
  and credited, is better still.
- Every found picture is downloaded into the project, credited on the page and listed in the report.
  None is presented as the client's own.
- Nothing ever lies on top of a headline or a statement (the inspector fails it).

**Components**
- Buttons: flat, one fill colour, either square-cornered or fully round, decided once (top sites: 52%
  square, 23% pill; the 9–16px "soft" radius is the weak-site default). Most strong heroes have no
  button at all, or one.
- Navigation: wordmark, three to five plain links, one action. No bar chrome.
- A control explains how to use it by its form, its label and its place. When it seems to need a
  sentence on how to operate it, redesign the control instead of adding the sentence. What a field
  accepts is different. First remove the limit where you can: a date picker, or a parser that takes
  any common format. A limit that remains, such as password rules or file type and size, stays visible
  beside the field and is tied to it with `aria-describedby`.
- The footer is a designed close, not a sitemap: on most strong sites the name returns at full width.
